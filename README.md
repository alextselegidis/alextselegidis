## About

Hello and welcome to my place! My name is Alex Tselegidis and I am a software engineer from Greece. I have been working 
as a programmer for the past 15+ years and have spent countless hours of imagining, solving and planning things that 
come in my way. I am always very serious with what I do and my ambitions are always high as to never let myself down. 
All I am looking forward is the next project.

## Work

During all these years I have been involved into a huge variety of projects, covering a vast spectrum of software 
engineering. Here are some of my open source projects that are hosted on Github and are definitely worth checking. 

### Easy!Appointments 

Easy!Appointments is a highly customizable web application that allows your customers to book appointments with you via 
the web. Moreover, it provides the ability to sync your data with Google Calendar so you can use them with other services.

### Plainpad 

Plainpad is a self hosted, open source note taking application that is very easy to setup on your server. Your data 
will never leave your server and you will be able to access them from any device connected to the internet.

### Spaceguard 

The original purpose of this project was to experiment with the available graphic APIs of the browsers, along with the 
implementation of an arcade game with simple game mechanics and animation.

## Collaborate 

Having worked with companies for that long, I have specialized into helping professionals reach their ultimate goals 
and explore all the possibilities beyond them. Always being open for discussion and brainstorming sessions, feel free 
to reach out with your inquiry and get started with your own project asap.
